# Fyodorov CLI Tool

The Fyodorov CLI tool is designed to streamline your interaction with Fyodorov services, including authentication, and deployment. Below are the instructions to get started with signing up and deploying your configuration.

## Installation

Before using the Fyodorov CLI tool, ensure you downloaded the correct binary for your system: https://github.com/FyodorovAI/fyodorov-cli/releases

## Signing Up

To start using the Fyodorov services, you must first sign up and authenticate. You can do this directly through the CLI tool:

```shell
./fyodorov auth
```

You can use the hosted version at [https://gagarin.danielransom.com](https://gagarin.danielransom.com) to sign up and test your models.

You will need an invite code. If you weren't provided with one you can try this one: `GITHUB`

## Deploying the Configuration

If you haven't already created a configuration file, here's an example `config.yml` to get started:
```yaml
version: 0.0.1
providers:
  - name: openai
    api_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
models:
  - name: chatgpt
    provider: openai
    model_info:
      mode: chat
      base_model: gpt-3.5-turbo
agents:
  - name: My Agent
    description: My agent for chat conversations
    model: chatgpt
    prompt: My name is Daniel. Please greet me and politely answer my questions.
```

Once your configuration is set and saved, you can deploy it using the Fyodorov CLI tool:

```shell
./fyodorov deploy config.yml
```

This command will deploy your current configuration to the Fyodorov platform. However, you will need to 
set the API key for the provider. You can create an API key for OpenAI [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

Here's an example of deploying the above file, and setting the API key for the OpenAI provider from an env file:

```shell
cat .env
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-EXAMPLE_API_KEY
source .env
./fyodorov deploy test_config.yaml --set "providers[0].api_key=$OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

## Chatting with your agent
The command `./fyodorov chat` allows you to interact with an agent from the command line tool. 
If you just run that command, you will see a list of agents you have deployed, with their name followed by their ID.

![Example of using `./fyodorov chat`](./imgs/fyodorov_chat.png)

In the example configuration above, we created an agent called `"My Agent"`. We can chat with this specific agent 
by using this command:
```shell
./fyodorov chat "My Agent"
```
You will be able to chat with your agent like this:

## Getting Help

For more detailed information about each command, you can use the help flag:
```shell
./fyodorov [command] --help
```
For example:

```shell
./fyodorov deploy --help
```
This will provide detailed usage instructions for the deploy command.
